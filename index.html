        <h1>Partner with Us</h1>
        <p>We need your expertise to help solve logistical challenges in the online auction industry!</p>
        <p>Remote online buyers are often deterred from participating in thousands of auctions each year due to the complexities of coordinating pick-up, loading/unloading, packing, and shipping from local auction houses.</p>
        <p>Auction Assist aims to establish relationships between auction websites, online buyers, and local logistic services to simplify and streamline the post-auction experience.</p>
        <p>For a 5% referral fee, we will connect your local services with our online auction integration software, providing access to a vast network of remote online auction buyers seeking your services from across the country.</p>
